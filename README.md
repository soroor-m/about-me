# About Me

About Me is a web application built with React, TypeScript, and JavaScript. 
It provides a simple platform to showcase information about me, such as my work experience, education, hobbies, books and contact information.
React Router library is used for routing, allowing users to navigate between different pages of the application.
The project follows a standard React project structure, with separate folders for components and pages.
I used Node-Sass for writing and compiling Sass files into CSS for styling in the project.
